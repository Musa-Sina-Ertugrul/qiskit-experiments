upgrade_expdata:
  - |
    "add_data" method on ExperimenData class hass been upgraded (Refactored).It
    bootstraps missing experiment_data instances and fills their inside with 
    parent experiment_data instance data.
    ExperimentData class decomposes its own data by itself,
    "_decompose_component_data" handles that.
upgrade_companalysis:
  - |
    "_run_analysis" method on CompositeAnalysis class does not need bootstrapping
    methods after ExperimentData class refactoring. Therefore, some methods has been
    deprecated and "_run_analysis" method has been refactored according to that.
    This refactoring has been reduced coupling.
deprecations:
  - |
    After refactoring ExperimenData class there are no need for 
    "run", "_component_experiment_data", "_marginalized_component_data",
    "_format_memory", "_add_child_data", "_initialize_component_experiment_data".
